      <description>Reports with headers in Reporting Services works great as long as you are just rendering the reports in HTML. If you would try to export the report to Excel you might stumble into some problems.
As long as the header design follows the rest of the design when it comes to columns you could be fine. However, often headers contain very different information and design than the actual content of the report and column alignment might in these cases become a problem.</description>
