                        <p>Deploying a function app without downtime should be standard practice for anyone working with Azure Functions, but it does not come out of the box.

In this post I will go through how this can be achieved using CD-pipelines in Azure DevOps.</p>

                        <p>For a while now I have felt that it takes too long time for me to write blog posts. I spend a long time figuring out how to make the post look right, when I should be spending time on the content. In the end this puts me off writing, because I know it will require a lot of effort. Because of that I have now moved the blog from Blogger to GitHub Pages using Hugo as static site generator to make it easier and quicker to write content.</p>

                        <p>Pester 5 was released a couple of days ago which brings a lot of new features and changes to how we write tests. One of the major changes in Pester 5 is the Discovery phase. In this post I will attempt to explain how Discovery works and how to use it to generate test cases.
Tests are executed in two phases Whenever you run tests with Pester 5 there will always be two phases, the Discovery phase and the Run phase.</p>

                        <p>Deploying a function app without downtime should be standard practice for anyone working with Azure Functions, but it does not come out of the box. It requires an understanding of how function apps gets configured, how deployment slots can help and why warmup does not necessarily mean your solution is up and running.
