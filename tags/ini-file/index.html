            Pester 5 was released a couple of days ago which brings a lot of new features and changes to how we write tests. One of the major changes in Pester 5 is the Discovery phase. In this post I will attempt to explain how Discovery works and how to use it to generate test cases.
Tests are executed in two phases Whenever you run tests with Pester 5 there will always be two phases, the Discovery phase and the Run phase.

            Did you know that there are a lot of built-in cmdlets which are written entirely in PowerShell? Did you also know that you can view the source of those cmdlets? Well, you can. Get-Command shows all the details we need. When you run Get-Command you get all kinds of details about the commands you are looking for. One of the properties in the output is called ScriptBlock. That&rsquo;s where the code is, if its written in PowerShell.

            To help prevent cross-site scripting attacks some websites uses anti-forgery tokens. If you would like to talk to a REST API which uses this security measure you might run into problems if you are trying to use the PowerShell cmdlet Invoke-RestMethod. I have seen some people suggesting that Invoke-RestMethod does not have support for this, which is not true. It&rsquo;s just a little bit more complicated than expected.
What&rsquo;s needed is basically a custom header and a cookie.

            Some time ago I wanted to find a DSC resource which would help me in configuring ini files. I did not really find any resource which was dynamic enough for my needs so I ended up writing my own. Since I want my DSC resources to contain as little code as possible I prefer to create cmdlets outside of the resource which I can call from within the resource. In this way I can also use the cmdlets in scripts and the console which is a nice bonus.

            Once in a while you want to check how stable a connection is between computers. You might want to ping one or two machines from several others to find out if there is some issues with the network somewhere. You could use the built-in cmdlet Test-Connection and log the results to a log file but then you will not be able to log timeouts since the cmdlet returns an error when timeouts occur.

            If you are following this blog you might have noticed some small changes here and there. I have been playing around with CSS in search of something that I like. While playing with CSS I started to wonder how hard it would be to create the PowerShell logo with only CSS, and it turned out it was not that hard. Unfortunately it requires some CSS3 components which not all browsers support, so depending on your browser the logo in the end of this post might or might not show properly.

            When long strings need to be generated it could sometimes be cumbersome to keep adding strings together, especially if you want the string to contain several lines, tabs and special characters. Here-string can solve that problem and is very easy to use.
Lets first look at a simple example of how regular strings work with variables, new lines and tabs. After that we look at an example of how to use here-string instead to make the code easier to read.

            When creating script cmdlets in PowerShell you can use dynamic parameters to create some advanced parameters. A few months back I was playing around a bit with dynamic parameters to see how it works and I noticed that the logic for the dynamic parameters is executed as soon as the verb is written in the console within PowerShell ISE.
Let&rsquo;s create a cmdlet to prove this theory. The cmdlet below will simply open a text file in the PowerShell ISE from the folder C:\temp.

            Expressions in PowerShell have a weird syntax and can quickly become complicated and hard to read. I thought about a way to make the syntax a bit easier to read and came up with a solution that might work for some cases. This solution contains two classes which can be used when piping to Select-Object for example. The first class describes the actual expression.
class Xpression { [string]$Name [scriptblock]$Expression [hashtable] getExpression() { return @{ Name = $this.
