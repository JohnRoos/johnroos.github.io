                        <p>I have seen a lot of people writing PowerShell scripts to compress files or folders by using external file compression programs. Often Winrar, 7-Zip or something similar is used since PowerShell does not have any built in cmdlet to do this (not until version 5 at least).
There is however a pretty simple way of doing this with only PowerShell. This is how.
# First we add the .Net framework class needed for file compression.</p>

There is however a pretty simple way of doing this with only PowerShell. This is how.
