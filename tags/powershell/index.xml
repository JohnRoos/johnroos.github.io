      <title>Deploy Azure Function App without downtime</title>

      <description>Deploying a function app without downtime should be standard practice for anyone working with Azure Functions, but it does not come out of the box. It requires an understanding of how function apps gets configured, how deployment slots can help and why warmup does not necessarily mean your solution is up and running. In this post I will go through how this can be achieved using CD-pipelines in Azure DevOps.</description>

      <description>Pester 5 was released a couple of days ago which brings a lot of new features and changes to how we write tests. One of the major changes in Pester 5 is the Discovery phase. In this post I will attempt to explain how Discovery works and how to use it to generate test cases.
Tests are executed in two phases Whenever you run tests with Pester 5 there will always be two phases, the Discovery phase and the Run phase.</description>

      <description>Azure Table storage is a quick and easy way to store data in the cloud. If you have an Azure subscription you can play around with you are up and running within minutes. Here is a short example on how to get started.
Create table To create an Azure Table we need to first have a resource group. Lets create one that is called &amp;ldquo;MyAwesomeResourceGroup&amp;rdquo; and place it in &amp;ldquo;West Europe&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Did you know that there are a lot of built-in cmdlets which are written entirely in PowerShell? Did you also know that you can view the source of those cmdlets? Well, you can. Get-Command shows all the details we need. When you run Get-Command you get all kinds of details about the commands you are looking for. One of the properties in the output is called ScriptBlock. That&amp;rsquo;s where the code is, if its written in PowerShell.</description>

      <description>To help prevent cross-site scripting attacks some websites uses anti-forgery tokens. If you would like to talk to a REST API which uses this security measure you might run into problems if you are trying to use the PowerShell cmdlet Invoke-RestMethod. I have seen some people suggesting that Invoke-RestMethod does not have support for this, which is not true. It&amp;rsquo;s just a little bit more complicated than expected.
What&amp;rsquo;s needed is basically a custom header and a cookie.</description>

      <title>Introducing the IniManager module</title>

      <guid>http://blog.roostech.se/posts/introducing-the-inimanager-module/</guid>
      <description>Some time ago I wanted to find a DSC resource which would help me in configuring ini files. I did not really find any resource which was dynamic enough for my needs so I ended up writing my own. Since I want my DSC resources to contain as little code as possible I prefer to create cmdlets outside of the resource which I can call from within the resource. In this way I can also use the cmdlets in scripts and the console which is a nice bonus.</description>

      <description>Once in a while you want to check how stable a connection is between computers. You might want to ping one or two machines from several others to find out if there is some issues with the network somewhere. You could use the built-in cmdlet Test-Connection and log the results to a log file but then you will not be able to log timeouts since the cmdlet returns an error when timeouts occur.</description>

      <description>If you are following this blog you might have noticed some small changes here and there. I have been playing around with CSS in search of something that I like. While playing with CSS I started to wonder how hard it would be to create the PowerShell logo with only CSS, and it turned out it was not that hard. Unfortunately it requires some CSS3 components which not all browsers support, so depending on your browser the logo in the end of this post might or might not show properly.</description>

      <description>When long strings need to be generated it could sometimes be cumbersome to keep adding strings together, especially if you want the string to contain several lines, tabs and special characters. Here-string can solve that problem and is very easy to use.
Lets first look at a simple example of how regular strings work with variables, new lines and tabs. After that we look at an example of how to use here-string instead to make the code easier to read.</description>

      <title>Dynamic parameters in PowerShell executes before you know it</title>

      <guid>http://blog.roostech.se/posts/dynamic-parameters-in-powershell-executes-before-you-know-it/</guid>
      <description>When creating script cmdlets in PowerShell you can use dynamic parameters to create some advanced parameters. A few months back I was playing around a bit with dynamic parameters to see how it works and I noticed that the logic for the dynamic parameters is executed as soon as the verb is written in the console within PowerShell ISE.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a cmdlet to prove this theory. The cmdlet below will simply open a text file in the PowerShell ISE from the folder C:\temp.</description>

      <description>Expressions in PowerShell have a weird syntax and can quickly become complicated and hard to read. I thought about a way to make the syntax a bit easier to read and came up with a solution that might work for some cases. This solution contains two classes which can be used when piping to Select-Object for example. The first class describes the actual expression.
class Xpression { [string]$Name [scriptblock]$Expression [hashtable] getExpression() { return @{ Name = $this.</description>

      <description>There are a few ways of getting data from SQL Server in PowerShell. This is one way of doing it which is quite simple and does not require the SQL Server module. The sample below shows how to get started. If you are planning on creating a script for serious use you need to add error handling and investigate a bit more what each line actually does so that you are in full control.</description>

      <title>How to use splatting in PowerShell</title>

      <guid>http://blog.roostech.se/posts/how-to-use-splatting-in-powershell/</guid>
      <description>I still hear a lot of people who don&amp;rsquo;t know how splatting works in Powershell. Splatting was introduced in Powershell 2.0 so it has been around for a while and it can make scripts look more clean and easy to read. This is how Microsoft explains splatting:
 Splatting is a method of passing a collection of parameter values to a command as unit. Windows PowerShell associates each value in the collection with a command parameter.</description>

      <description>Some time ago I was playing around a bit with Invoke-WebRequest and wanted to know a bit more about what I could do with that cmdlet. I ended up creating a cmdlet to get movie information from IMDB.com. I thought I would share how that script since the same principles can be applied in many situations.

      <guid>http://blog.roostech.se/posts/classes-in-powershell-5.0/</guid>
      <description>One of the big new features in Powershell 5.0 is classes. You can now define your own classes and create objects based on those custom classes. You can even create your own version of an existing class using inheritance.
In previous version of Powershell it was actually possible to create classes, but you had to write code in other languages like C# or Visual basic and then use that piece of code as the definition of the class.</description>

      <description>Do you want to get started with Powershell but you dont know where to start? To get you started I have collected a bunch of links which has helped a lot of people to get going with Powershell. These links range from the most basic introductions to advanced scripting and history lessons. Lets start with the basic stuff to anyone new to Powershell. These links are also good if you have learned by yourself over the years, since it might help you break bad habbits you dont know you have.</description>

      <guid>http://blog.roostech.se/posts/powershell-script-find-hotfix-status/</guid>
      <description>I was browsing around the requests on the Microsoft Script Center the other day and found one request where a user needed a PowerShell script for showing the status of specific hotfixes on multiple machines. I thought it would be a good idea since Get-Hotfix only shows where the hotfix is installed but not directly where its not installed.
I created a simple small script that would list the patches to check for, along with each server and if its installed or not.</description>

      <title>Powershell script: Write object to SQL</title>
      <link>http://blog.roostech.se/posts/powershell-script-write-object-to-sql/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.roostech.se/posts/powershell-script-write-object-to-sql/</guid>
      <description>A while ago I was playing around with PowerShell, gathering information from a lot of servers and I felt that I needed to have a simple way of storing that information in a database. I could have written my own T-SQL statements for creating the tables and then do the inserts in the powerShell scripts I was playing around with. But that felt like it would just take time so I started to think about a function that would just accept any object and do the magic of creating a table and then inserting anything I piped to it.</description>

      <guid>http://blog.roostech.se/posts/get-type-alternative-for-null-values/</guid>
      <description>Sometimes its useful to get information about object properties in PowerShell. You might be writing a script where you want to extract information from a series of objects and you need to know what data type a property contains. Often this is not a big problem since you can use the GetType function that most objects have.
Then you run in to the problem that I had recently: You expect a series of objects and you check the types on the properties and suddenly a few of them doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the function GetType for some reason.</description>

      <guid>http://blog.roostech.se/posts/compress-files-to-zip-with-powershell/</guid>
      <description>I have seen a lot of people writing PowerShell scripts to compress files or folders by using external file compression programs. Often Winrar, 7-Zip or something similar is used since PowerShell does not have any built in cmdlet to do this (not until version 5 at least).
There is however a pretty simple way of doing this with only PowerShell. This is how.
# First we add the .Net framework class needed for file compression.</description>

      <description>This is for experimenting with RemoteFX in Hyper-V in a lab environment using Windows Server 2012. I wanted to see what I could do with RemoteFX on a slow GPU. To see how far I could get I started off with the Intel HD 2500, which is built into the Intel Core i5 3550 processor (Ivy Bridge). You can go through these steps with any supported hardware, and you probably get better results if you don&amp;rsquo;t use the HD 2500 as I did.</description>

      <guid>http://blog.roostech.se/posts/sqlps-and-its-limitations/</guid>
      <description>SQL Server PowerShell (SQLPS) enables some new possibilities when it comes to managing your instances, but it also comes with some limitations. These limitations are not always obvious and can sometimes be worked around. To understand the limitations you must first understand that SQLPS is not PowerShell V1, V2 or V3 but rather a mini shell on its own. It was created by Microsoft as a mini shell based on PowerShell V1 so the cmdlets available are based on V1.</description>
