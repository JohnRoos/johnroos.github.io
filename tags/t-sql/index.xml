      <description>A while ago I was playing around with PowerShell, gathering information from a lot of servers and I felt that I needed to have a simple way of storing that information in a database. I could have written my own T-SQL statements for creating the tables and then do the inserts in the powerShell scripts I was playing around with. But that felt like it would just take time so I started to think about a function that would just accept any object and do the magic of creating a table and then inserting anything I piped to it.</description>

      <description>Since TempDB is a system database you should not try to move the database with detach/attach or backup/restore. Instead you should move the files with a simple script and after the next restart of the instance the files will be relocated to the new location.
First check where the files are currently located so that you can easily just copy and paste the name and paths if needed:
SELECT name, type_desc, physical_name FROM sys.</description>
