            There are a few ways of getting data from SQL Server in PowerShell. This is one way of doing it which is quite simple and does not require the SQL Server module. The sample below shows how to get started. If you are planning on creating a script for serious use you need to add error handling and investigate a bit more what each line actually does so that you are in full control.

            I still hear a lot of people who don&rsquo;t know how splatting works in Powershell. Splatting was introduced in Powershell 2.0 so it has been around for a while and it can make scripts look more clean and easy to read. This is how Microsoft explains splatting:
 Splatting is a method of passing a collection of parameter values to a command as unit. Windows PowerShell associates each value in the collection with a command parameter.

            One of the big new features in Powershell 5.0 is classes. You can now define your own classes and create objects based on those custom classes. You can even create your own version of an existing class using inheritance.
In previous version of Powershell it was actually possible to create classes, but you had to write code in other languages like C# or Visual basic and then use that piece of code as the definition of the class.

These links range from the most basic introductions to advanced scripting and history lessons. Lets start with the basic stuff to anyone new to Powershell. These links are also good if you have learned by yourself over the years, since it might help you break bad habbits you dont know you have.

            I was browsing around the requests on the Microsoft Script Center the other day and found one request where a user needed a PowerShell script for showing the status of specific hotfixes on multiple machines. I thought it would be a good idea since Get-Hotfix only shows where the hotfix is installed but not directly where its not installed.
I created a simple small script that would list the patches to check for, along with each server and if its installed or not.

            A while ago I was playing around with PowerShell, gathering information from a lot of servers and I felt that I needed to have a simple way of storing that information in a database. I could have written my own T-SQL statements for creating the tables and then do the inserts in the powerShell scripts I was playing around with. But that felt like it would just take time so I started to think about a function that would just accept any object and do the magic of creating a table and then inserting anything I piped to it.

            Sometimes its useful to get information about object properties in PowerShell. You might be writing a script where you want to extract information from a series of objects and you need to know what data type a property contains. Often this is not a big problem since you can use the GetType function that most objects have.
Then you run in to the problem that I had recently: You expect a series of objects and you check the types on the properties and suddenly a few of them doesn&rsquo;t have the function GetType for some reason.

            I have seen a lot of people writing PowerShell scripts to compress files or folders by using external file compression programs. Often Winrar, 7-Zip or something similar is used since PowerShell does not have any built in cmdlet to do this (not until version 5 at least).
There is however a pretty simple way of doing this with only PowerShell. This is how.
