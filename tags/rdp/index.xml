      <description>A few days ago Microsoft finally announced that they will be releasing Remote Desktop Protocol 8.0 for Windows 7 SP1. Earlier it was not clear if this would be released for Windows 7 or if RDP 8.0 would be exclusive for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. RDP 8.0 should give some proper improvements when it comes to hardware accelerated graphics in Hyper-V with the RemoteFX capabilities. Among many improvements there are some new compression algorithms which will lower the bandwidth needed for RDP sessions where some parts of the screen might use a different algorithm compared to other parts, and even mixing UDP and TCP on different parts of the screen depending on what&amp;rsquo;s displayed.</description>
