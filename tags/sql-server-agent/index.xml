      <description>SQL Server PowerShell (SQLPS) enables some new possibilities when it comes to managing your instances, but it also comes with some limitations. These limitations are not always obvious and can sometimes be worked around. To understand the limitations you must first understand that SQLPS is not PowerShell V1, V2 or V3 but rather a mini shell on its own. It was created by Microsoft as a mini shell based on PowerShell V1 so the cmdlets available are based on V1.</description>

      <description>This is a very easy way to automate something which can take quite some time to do manually if you have lots of environments. Its made as easy as possible in this example rather than fancy and complicated. This script will create a SQL Server Agent Job which will execute a number of SSIS packages (dtsx files). The script will look for dtsx files in the selected folder DTSVirtualPath and also a config file (dtsConfig).</description>
