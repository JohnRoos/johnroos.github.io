      <description>Sometimes its useful to get information about object properties in PowerShell. You might be writing a script where you want to extract information from a series of objects and you need to know what data type a property contains. Often this is not a big problem since you can use the GetType function that most objects have.
Then you run in to the problem that I had recently: You expect a series of objects and you check the types on the properties and suddenly a few of them doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the function GetType for some reason.</description>
