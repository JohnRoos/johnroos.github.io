                <p>When you deploy an Azure Function app you also deploy the configuration for each function within the app. What if you would like to inspect the configuration of a function within a function app? If the function is using a timerTrigger, you might want to be able to look at that schedule for example. That would be easy to do using the Azure Portal, but what if you need to do it using PowerShell?</p>

                <p>Deploying a function app without downtime should be standard practice for anyone working with Azure Functions, but it does not come out of the box. It requires an understanding of how function apps gets configured, how deployment slots can help and why warmup does not necessarily mean your solution is up and running. In this post I will go through how this can be achieved using CD-pipelines in Azure DevOps.</p>

                <p>For a while now I have felt that it takes too long time for me to write blog posts. I spend a long time figuring out how to make the post look right, when I should be spending time on the content. In the end this puts me off writing, because I know it will require a lot of effort. Because of that I have now moved the blog from Blogger to GitHub Pages using Hugo as static site generator to make it easier and quicker to write content.</p>

                <p>Pester 5 was released a couple of days ago which brings a lot of new features and changes to how we write tests. One of the major changes in Pester 5 is the Discovery phase. In this post I will attempt to explain how Discovery works and how to use it to generate test cases.
Tests are executed in two phases Whenever you run tests with Pester 5 there will always be two phases, the Discovery phase and the Run phase.</p>

Create table To create an Azure Table we need to first have a resource group. Lets create one that is called &ldquo;MyAwesomeResourceGroup&rdquo; and place it in &ldquo;West Europe&rdquo;.</p>

                <p>Did you know that there are a lot of built-in cmdlets which are written entirely in PowerShell? Did you also know that you can view the source of those cmdlets? Well, you can. Get-Command shows all the details we need. When you run Get-Command you get all kinds of details about the commands you are looking for. One of the properties in the output is called ScriptBlock. That&rsquo;s where the code is, if its written in PowerShell.</p>

                <p>To help prevent cross-site scripting attacks some websites uses anti-forgery tokens. If you would like to talk to a REST API which uses this security measure you might run into problems if you are trying to use the PowerShell cmdlet Invoke-RestMethod. I have seen some people suggesting that Invoke-RestMethod does not have support for this, which is not true. It&rsquo;s just a little bit more complicated than expected.
What&rsquo;s needed is basically a custom header and a cookie.</p>

                <p>Some time ago I wanted to find a DSC resource which would help me in configuring ini files. I did not really find any resource which was dynamic enough for my needs so I ended up writing my own. Since I want my DSC resources to contain as little code as possible I prefer to create cmdlets outside of the resource which I can call from within the resource. In this way I can also use the cmdlets in scripts and the console which is a nice bonus.</p>

                <p>Once in a while you want to check how stable a connection is between computers. You might want to ping one or two machines from several others to find out if there is some issues with the network somewhere. You could use the built-in cmdlet Test-Connection and log the results to a log file but then you will not be able to log timeouts since the cmdlet returns an error when timeouts occur.</p>

                <p>If you are following this blog you might have noticed some small changes here and there. I have been playing around with CSS in search of something that I like. While playing with CSS I started to wonder how hard it would be to create the PowerShell logo with only CSS, and it turned out it was not that hard. Unfortunately it requires some CSS3 components which not all browsers support, so depending on your browser the logo in the end of this post might or might not show properly.</p>

                <p>When you deploy an Azure Function app you also deploy the configuration for each function within the app. What if you would like to inspect the configuration of a function within a function app? If the function is using a timerTrigger, you might want to be able to look at that schedule for example. That would be easy to do using the Azure Portal, but what if you need to do it using PowerShell?</p>
